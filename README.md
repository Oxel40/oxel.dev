# oxel.dev

This is the source code for the [oxel.dev](https://oxel.dev) website. The content is generated using `make`, `pandoc`, `bash` and standard Unix shell utilities.

The site draws inspiration from [notthebe.ee](https://notthebe.ee) by Wolfgang (especially the version depicted in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ttw2Dihn8)), with the CSS styling heavily based on the CSS found on [notthebe.ee](https://notthebe.ee).

The colors and syntax highlighting is set to mimic the `OneDark` color scheme.
